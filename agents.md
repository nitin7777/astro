# Repository Setup Instructions

This project is a small Node server and HTML/JavaScript app. To get started:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher is recommended).
2. Clone the repository and install any dependencies (none are currently required).
3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

4. Open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser to see the app.

If you want Google Sign-In to work, create a Google OAuth client ID and replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` in `index.html` with your own value.
